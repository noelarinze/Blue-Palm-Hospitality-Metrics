## Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows;
In the vibrant world of hospitality, understanding guest behavior, optimizing revenue channels, and reducing booking friction are crucial to staying competitive. The Blue Palm Hospitality Group has used insightful metrics to dissect customer booking patterns, channel performance, and operational bottlenecks.
With a total revenue of 29.6 million, over 119,000 customers, and an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of 12.16M, the group has achieved notable growth. However, deeper analysis reveals room for strategic realignment especially in how distribution channels are managed and cancellations mitigated.

Chapter 1: Booking Patterns
The year starts strong with bookings peaking above 15K in January, but a downward slope emerges through the spring, reaching a low in June. A moderate recovery unfolds in the second half of the year, particularly in October.
Insight:
The sharp early-year activity suggests a strong winter demand possibly from holiday travelers or early corporate events while the summer lull might hint at competitive market dynamics or shifting customer preferences. Actionable promotional strategies in Q2 could flatten the dip.

Chapter 2: Distribution Channels 
1. Dominance of Online Travel Agents (OTAs)
- OTAs account for 64.57% of lead time share.
- They generate the highest booking volume and ADR (near 10M).
- However, they also carry the highest cancellation rate (72.83%), leading to the greatest revenue loss from cancellations.

2. Corporate and Direct Channels
- Corporate bookings, while limited in volume, command a healthy ADR and low cancellation impact.
- Direct bookings form only 14.98% of total channel revenue but offer more control and better customer retention opportunities.

ðŸ“Œ Strategic Implication:
Heavy reliance on OTAs is a mixed blessing high visibility and bookings, but costly cancellations. Investing in direct booking incentives, loyalty programs, and corporate partnerships can reduce dependency and improve margins.

Chapter 3: Geography
- Revenue by country reveals Portugal as the top-performing market, contributing over 8M, followed by the UK, France, Spain, and Germany.

ðŸŽ¯ Opportunity:
Explore what makes Portugal successful seasonality, local partnerships, travel campaigns and replicate those success factors in underperforming regions like Germany.

Chapter 4: Customer Segments
- Transient guests drive the majority of revenue.
- Other segments such as Contract, Group, and Transient-Party remain minor contributors.
  
 ðŸŽ¯ Opportunity:
Introduce tailored packages or offers to diversify customer types especially for groups and corporate clients, which are more predictable and profitable.

Chapter 5: Cancellation Conundrum
- Despite high bookings, 43K cancellations were recorded:
- OTAs contribute the lionâ€™s share of cancellation-driven revenue loss.
- Direct and corporate channels show significantly lower cancellation tendencies.

ðŸ”§ Recommendation:
- Employ stricter cancellation policies or dynamic pricing for OTA bookings.
- Consider pre-paid, non-refundable options for high-cancellation periods.

Chapter 6: Lead Time & Operational Planning
- The pie chart on Lead Time by Distribution Channel reveals:
- OTAs book earlier, providing more lead time for planning.
- Direct bookings are often late-stage, requiring responsive operational readiness.

 Insight:
Align marketing campaigns with lead-time behaviors early deals through OTAs, last-minute flash sales via direct channels.

Chapter 7: Where Are Guests Coming From?
- The Distribution of Guests by Country reveals:
- Portugal dominates with 90K guests.
- UK follows distantly with 25K, and France, Spain, and Germany round out the top 5.
- Other countries like Brazil, China, and Belgium have smaller but noteworthy presence (~5K each).

 Insight:
Portugal is not just a leader in revenue, but also in guest count. This may indicate strong domestic tourism or brand loyalty in the local market.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:
- Localize marketing in high-volume countries (Portugal, UK, France).
- Use targeted campaigns in under-tapped markets (Germany, Italy, Brazil) to grow presence.

Chapter 8: Length of Stay â€” Channel vs. Customer Type
- The Length of Stay chart shows:
- Guests from undefined channels and transient-party types stay the longest (up to ~8 nights).
- Corporate and direct bookings show moderately longer stays (~4â€“5 nights).
- OTA and offline agent guests have slightly shorter stays on average.

 Insight:
The highest value in terms of stay duration comes from transient-party guests via undefined or direct channels.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:
- Promote multi-night stay packages targeting transient-party guests.
- Improve clarity around the "Undefined" channel to leverage this segment better.

Chapter 9: Corporate Bookings 
From the Corporate Booking Analysis:
- Most bookings are transient-type, even in corporate channels.
- Group and contract bookings are significantly lower.

Insight:
Corporate channels are under-leveraged for group and contract bookings, which are usually more stable and lucrative.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:
- Develop corporate packages tailored to groups and long-term contracts.
- Assign B2B sales reps to drive more business from the corporate segment.

 Chapter 10: Deposit Types
The Impact of Deposit Types pie chart reveals:
- A whopping 87.67% of bookings require no deposit.
- Only 12.18% require deposits, and cancellations are high across the board.

 Insight:
Low deposit requirements strongly correlate with high cancellation rates, echoing patterns seen in OTAs.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:
- Introduce flexible but tiered deposit policies (e.g., partial deposit for bookings >3 nights).
- Offer incentives like discounts or perks for prepaid stays to reduce cancellations.

 Chapter 11: Revenue Leakage 
In Revenue by Status:
- 87.82% of revenue is realized (check-outs).
- 12.15% is lost to cancellations, and a minor 0.03% to no-shows.

 Insight:
Cancellations account for a significant revenue gap, likely tied to lenient cancellation terms and reliance on OTA bookings.

ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation:
- Enforce stricter cancellation policies, particularly during peak periods.
- Encourage non-refundable or semi-flex bookings, especially through direct channels.
